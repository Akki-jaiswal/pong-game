* **Pause & Resume:** Take a break anytime with a simple pause/resume function.
* **Score Tracking:** Keep track of both player and AI scores in real-time.
* **Countdown System:** A "3-2-1-GO!" countdown adds a nice touch before each round.
* **Engaging Sound Effects & Background Music:** Enjoy distinct sounds for game events and atmospheric background music.
* **Full Responsiveness:** Optimized for play on both desktop and mobile devices.
* **Touch Controls:** Intuitive touch-and-drag controls for mobile gameplay.
