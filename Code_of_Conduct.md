🎮 Code of Conduct — Pong-Game Open Source Project

🚀 Our Commitment
Welcome to the Pong Game Project — an open-source initiative built on fun, curiosity, and collective growth! Whether you're here to squash a bug, improve gameplay mechanics, enhance graphics, or simply learn the ropes of open-source collaboration, you belong.

We’re committed to creating an environment where everyone — from complete beginners to seasoned contributors — feels valued, respected, and safe. We believe that great games come from great communities, and that respect, inclusion, and kindness should be as fundamental as version control and code reviews.


🌟 Our Core Values:

In our pong-powered universe, we play by the following values:
- 🧠 Learn Openly: No question is too small, no contributor too new. We’re here to grow together.
- 🎮 Play Fair: Collaboration beats competition. Feedback should be kind, constructive, and focused on improvement.
- 🎉 Celebrate Contributions: From fixing typos to adding multiplayer support — every contribution matters.
- 🌍 Embrace Diversity: Different backgrounds, skill levels, and perspectives make our project better and stronger.
- 🧩 Work Together: Success is a team sport. Share knowledge, uplift others, and focus on solutions.


🛑 What We Don’t Tolerate

To protect our community and ensure a welcoming experience for all, we do not tolerate:
- 🚫 Disrespectful language or personal attacks
- 🚫 Harassment, discrimination, or hate speech
- 🚫 Gatekeeping or discouraging beginners
- 🚫 Unwanted private messages or contact outside official channels
- 🚫 Spam, off-topic promotion, or irrelevant content
- 🚫 Toxic competitiveness or putting down others’ work
- 🚫 Plagiarized code or cheating tools

Let’s keep the vibe positive and the game fun — for everyone!


🌐 Scope of This Code:

🧭 Reporting Issues
If you experience or witness misconduct, reach out directly to a project maintainer or admin. We take reports seriously and will handle them with confidentiality, care, and timely action.

This Code of Conduct was written specifically for the Pong-Game Project, inspired by best practices from open-source communities like [Contributor Covenant v2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) and customized to reflect our fun, beginner-friendly, game-loving ethos.

Let’s code. Let’s play. Let’s grow — together. 💚
